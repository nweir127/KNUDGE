amber_heights	
amber_heights_01	Amber Heights is a location in the Monarch Wilderness and the base of operations for the Iconoclasts.
amber_heights_02	The Iconoclasts run the place somewhat like a commune.
amber_heights_03	Amber Heights was once the place of residence of the entire executive dome of Monarch Stellar Industries.
amber_heights_04	It is now in ruins after a massacre in the past.
amber_heights_05	They lived there with their families and it was the company's operations center on Monarch.
amber_heights_06	Just after The Board approved the evacuation of the planet through the Hazard Clause, Amber Heights was besieged by a gang of pirates who ransacked the town and massacred all its inhabitants.
amber_heights_07	"This tragedy was known as ""The Amber Heights Massacre""."
amber_heights_08	They were secretly assisted by MSI employee, Graham Bryant, who believed that the massacre would aid him in his quest to rid the colony of corporate influence.
amber_heights_09	In 2345, the same Graham Bryant formed the Iconoclasts and settled the group in the deserted town.
bronson	
bronson_01	Bronson is the quartermaster for the Iconoclasts.
bronson_02	He is a vendor in Amber Heights.
bronson_03	Bronson acts as a jack of all trades for the Iconoclasts,
bronson_04	identifying himself as a quartermaster, chef, handyman,
bronson_05	and whatever other role the residents of Amber Heights need him to play.
iconoclasts	
iconoclasts_01	The Iconoclasts are a group of survivalists living in the ruins of Amber Heights on Monarch.
iconoclasts_02	They hope to one day tear down the corporate establishment that they believe has brought the colony to the brink of death.
iconoclasts_03	The Iconoclasts are a group of idealistic revolutionaries that seek to overthrow the corporate establishment that runs the Halcyon Colony.
iconoclasts_04	Based in the ruins of the Amber Heights settlement on Monarch,
iconoclasts_05	they are a tenacious group,
iconoclasts_06	and share some democratic ideals with Monarch Stellar Industries (MSI) against the more repressive actions of the Board.
iconoclasts_07	However, the Iconoclast's anti-corporate nature has put them at odds with MSI, a dispute that threatens to spill into all-out warfare.
iconoclasts_08	Given that the Iconoclasts are mostly followers of the Philosophist faith, they have been blacklisted and demonized by the Board as dissenters and anarchists.
iconoclasts_09	The group is led by Graham Bryant, a staunch Philosophist.
iconoclasts_10	Zora Blackwood, the Iconoclasts' chief of medicine, is also considered a de facto leader of the group,
iconoclasts_11	as she was alongside Graham when he founded the Iconoclasts,
iconoclasts_12	and almost every member of the Iconoclasts owes her their life in some way.
iconoclasts_13	The Iconoclasts maintain a tense relationship with MSI.
iconoclasts_14	Despite sharing democratic values and a common desire towards egalitarianism for the people of Monarch and the wider Halcyon colony,
iconoclasts_15	"MSI's ""egalitarian corporate structure"" has proven to be at odds with some of the Iconoclasts' more radical, anti-capitalist views."
iconoclasts_16	Depending on the actions of the Stranger, this tense relationship can either be resolved,
iconoclasts_17	or can spill into a drawn-out and bloody war.
iconoclasts_18	The Stranger meets the Iconoclasts in Amber Heights just as the tension between them and MSI is reaching boiling point.
iconoclasts_19	They can either side with the Iconoclasts and assist them in storming and taking over Stellar Bay,
iconoclasts_20	"""solve"" the Iconoclast problem for Stellar Bay,"
iconoclasts_21	or broker peace between the two factions.
iconoclasts_22	The Stranger can also have an impact on the leadership of the Iconoclasts - siding with either Graham Bryant or Zora Blackwood.
iconoclasts_23	To supplant Graham with Zora, evidence of Graham's involvement in the Amber Heights massacre must be found and presented to Zora.
iconoclasts_24	The Van Noys are the Iconoclasts' best unit.
