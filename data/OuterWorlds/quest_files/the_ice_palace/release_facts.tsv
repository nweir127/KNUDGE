ada_01	ADA (Autonomous Digital Astrogator) is an advanced AI aboard the Unreliable.
ada_02	She controls the navigation and communications systems of the ship.
ada_03	As ADA was programmed to recognize only Alex Hawthorne as the legal owner of the Unreliable,

ada_05	She is able to adapt and learn from the ship's operators to be able to better anticipate their needs.
automechanicals	
automechanicals_01	Automechanicals are robots in The Outer Worlds.
automechanicals_02	Taking on various shapes and forms,
automechanicals_03	from quadrupedal walkers,
automechanicals_04	to hovering drones,
automechanicals_05	to large humanoid mechs,
automechanicals_06	automechanicals function to provide various services to corporations and their owners in Halcyon.
automechanicals_07	Mechanicals are equipped with a large automatic cannon.
automechanicals_08	They are vulnerable to electromagnetic damage weaponry,
automechanicals_09	such as the stun baton.
cascadia

cascadia_02	It is now used as a stronghold by the Marauders.
cascadia_03	The main attraction is the Cascadia Bottling Plant and,
cascadia_04	for those in the know,
cascadia_05	the Rizzo Secret Laboratory hidden underneath the Rizzo Sweets Shoppe.
groundbreaker	
groundbreaker_01	UDL-001 The Groundbreaker or simply Groundbreaker was the first colony ship to arrive in Halcyon during the Crossing.
groundbreaker_02	By 2355, it has been converted into an independent orbital station,
groundbreaker_03	and is the only place in the entire Halcyon system that is not controlled by the Halcyon Holdings Corporate Board or any other corporation.
groundbreaker_04	The crew of the Groundbreaker is fiercely protective of their independence from the corporations,
groundbreaker_05	and the corporations value the station's role as a thriving freeport enough that they are willing to deal with it on relatively equal terms.
groundbreaker_06	In practical terms, while the Groundbreaker rules itself,
groundbreaker_07	it cooperates with the corporations to an extent,
groundbreaker_08	such as by impounding ships that the Board happens to flag.
groundbreaker_09	The Groundbreaker is commanded by engineer-turned-captain Junlei Tennyson.
groundbreaker_10	Udom Bedford is the Halcyon Holdings Corporation representative stationed aboard.
groundbreaker_11	According to Junlei, lots of corners were cut when the ship was built,
groundbreaker_12	prompting Captain Guiying Tennyson to spend half of her career attempting to patch the ship back together after the Crossing from Earth to Halcyon.
groundbreaker_13	In addition, the ship has tinkerings and bypasses that only the Tennysons know about.
groundbreaker_14	The Groundbreaker maintains a somewhat tense relationship with the Board,
groundbreaker_15	owing to their declared independence from Board authority,
groundbreaker_16	as well as their control of shipping routes outward from the Halcyon System.
groundbreaker_17	Nonetheless, given that Groundbreaker lacks any semblance of military might against the Board beyond the mardets stationed aboard the ship,
groundbreaker_18	the loose hierarchy in charge of the Groundbreaker often seeks to find (illicit) ways of delaying, stymieing, or pitting corporations under the Board's thumb against each other,
groundbreaker_19	usually through black market fences like Gladys Culkelly.
groundbreaker_20	Nonetheless, the Board maintains an embassy aboard the Groundbreaker run by bureaucrat Udom Bedford.
groundbreaker_21	Depending on the actions of the Stranger, the Groundbreaker's crew may be compelled to rebel against the Board's system-wide authority.
groundbreaker_22	The Groundbreaker is generally neutral to Sublight Salvage and Shipping Corporation,
groundbreaker_23	and allows them to operate an office and warehouse aboard the ship, helmed by Lilya Hagen.
hrs-1084	
hrs-1084_01	The Heliospheric Research Station 1084,
hrs-1084_02	otherwise known as HRS-1084 (or just ten-eighty-four),
hrs-1084_03	is a giant research station orbiting around in the Halcyon system.
hrs-1084_04	The Stranger can only travel to this location after starting the quest, The Ice Palace.
hrs-1084_05	Lilya Hagen tasks the Stranger with claiming the abandoned station in SubLight's name during the quest The Ice Palace.
hrs-1084_06	The station has been dark for some time and emits only a very weak docking signal.
lilya_hagen	
lilya_hagen_01	Lilya Hagen is the CEO of SubLight Salvage and Shipping Corporation,
lilya_hagen_02	based aboard the Groundbreaker.
lilya_hagen_03	Not much is known about Lilyaâ€™s early life besides for being a descendant from the original Groundbreaker colonists.
lilya_hagen_04	At some point Lilya joined the SubLight Salvage and Shipping Corporation and worked her way up to CEO.
lilya_hagen_05	The company was a full time job which caused her to lose sleep making her impatient and emotionless.
lilya_hagen_06	Lilya eventually only cared about profit and started to invest in dangerous jobs which (if not caught) would make her very rich.
lilya_hagen_07	Not wanting to get her hands dirty,
lilya_hagen_08	Lilya offers these jobs to mercenaries,
lilya_hagen_09	this eventually gets the attention of the Stranger.
lilya_hagen_10	She gets them to do to big jobs until she thinks a scientist in Byzantium is helping aliens after seeing evidence from the jobs.
lilya_hagen_11	If the scientist gets killed,
lilya_hagen_12	she makes the Stranger a high-ranking member.
override_cartridge	
override_cartridge_01	This cartridge is used to override a terminals remote access protocols on the HRS-1084.
override_cartridge_02	The keycard cartridge is given to the Stranger by Lilya Hagen on the Groundbreaker at the start of The Ice Palace.
sublight	
sublight_01	"The SubLight Salvage and Shipping Corporation, also known as SubLight Salvage and Shipping or simply SubLight , is a network of ""salvagers"" with business ties to ""transportation"" and ""waste disposal""."
sublight_02	A tangled web of contractors and secretive vice presidents make up their official hierarchy,
sublight_03	leaving no one to speak on the record about SubLight's more legally dubious activities.
sublight_04	SubLight as a business operates activities that would be considered illicit by some,
sublight_05	amoral by others,
sublight_06	and at odds with the Board,
sublight_07	such as the takeover of abandoned space habitats,
sublight_08	smuggling contraband,
sublight_09	and serving as a front for companies to bypass the infamous Hazard Clause applied on Monarch.
sublight_10	According to director Lilya Hagen,
sublight_11	operating off of Groundbreaker,
sublight_12	"SubLight ""occupies a legal blind spot."
sublight_13	No one knows what [they're] licensed to do,
sublight_14	"and that gives [their] little business some freedom."""
sublight_15	Although the Board tolerates and sees the value of SubLight's activities,
sublight_16	there are still limits to what the latter can get away with.
sublight_17	SubLight maintains an office aboard the Groundbreaker as well as a settlement on Monarch known as Fallbrook.
the_board	
the_board_01	The Halcyon Holdings Corporate Board, also simply known as The Board,
the_board_02	institutes policy and law throughout the Halcyon Colony.
the_board_03	The details surrounding the board's founding remain largely unknown,
the_board_04	though its activities suggest that it was originally founded some seventy-odd years ago, give or take.
the_board_05	In that time, it has managed to terraform Terra I
the_board_06	(a catastrophic failure due to mutations rendering the wildlife overwhelmingly hostile to human life).
the_board_07	The Board maintains a very tense relationship with MSI, owing to MSI's democratic ideals and their declared ownership of Monarch.
the_board_08	As a result, the Board has placed Monarch, and by extension, MSI, under the Hazard Clause, which forbids off-world businesses from doing transactions on Monarch without the correct (and deliberately impossible to complete) documents.
the_board_09	Depending on the actions of the Stranger, MSI may be compelled to rebel against the Board's authoritarianism.
udl	
udl_01	Universal Defense Logistics (UDL) is one of the ten corporations that founded the Halcyon Holdings Corporation.
udl_02	Its CEO, Rockwell, also serves as the Chairman of the Halcyon Holdings Corporate Board.
udl_03	They're the largest of the corps in Halcyon,
udl_04	having the largest stake there and in the board,
udl_05	as well as being the main presence in Byzantium,
udl_06	especially through their CEO, Chairman Rockwell.
udl_07	They're also the parent corporation to Spacer's Choice.
udl_08	They're pretty much the guiding hand in much of The Board's policies, actions, and screw ups.
