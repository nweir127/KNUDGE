c&p_boarst_factory_07	Under Clive's leadership, the employees were paid well and had steady work,

monarch	
monarch_01	Monarch, previously known as Terra 1, is one of the many moons of the gas giant Olympus and the site of a failed colony.
monarch_02	Terra 1 was initially designated as the primary colonization target of the Halcyon system.
monarch_03	The Halcyon Holdings Corporate Board had intended to completely terraform the moon,
monarch_04	wiping out the local fauna and flora and replacing it with plants and wildlife native to Earth.
monarch_05	However, the terraforming process unexpectedly caused the native species to mutate and grow to significantly larger sizes,
monarch_06	rendering them more dangerous and severely crippling the colonization effort.
monarch_07	Due to the hostile environment which they had created,
monarch_08	the Board was forced to enact a Hazard Clause covering the entirety of Terra 1.
monarch_09	Public notice of the clause's issuance was sent to everyone operating on Terra 1 and led to the evacuation of almost all corporations from the moon.
monarch_10	However, one corporation took advantage of the chaos of the evacuation to exploit a legal loophole which allowed them to,
monarch_11	as the last corporation remaining on the planet,
monarch_12	acquire the planet from the Board.
monarch_13	This corporation, under the leadership of Sanjar Nandi and Graham Bryant subsequently rebranded itself to Monarch Stellar Industries (MSI),
monarch_14	in line with the renaming of the planet to 'Monarch'.
monarch_15	The actions of MSI earned them the ire of the Board,
monarch_16	who retaliated by effectively placing the moon under indefinite embargo,
monarch_17	refusing to allow legal transit either in or out.
monarch_18	the Board aggressively spread propaganda about Monarch to convince the rest of the population that it was both uninhabited and uninhabitable.
monarch_19	This has greatly hampered MSI's attempts to be recognized as a legitimate corporation and is a thorn in the side of its CEO, Sanjar Nandi.
monarch_20	"Monarch also has an ocean which goes around the moon at the ""twilight band""."
monarch_21	It is where the colonists and Monarch Stellar Industries farm their saltuna.
saltuna	
saltuna_01	The saltuna is an aquatic creature native to Terra 2.
saltuna_02	They are commonly cultivated as a food source,
saltuna_03	being used to produce various products around the system.
saltuna_04	The saltuna (Salmonidae salinis) is an aquatic creature native to Terra 2.
sublight	
sublight_01	"The SubLight Salvage and Shipping Corporation, also known as SubLight Salvage and Shipping or simply SubLight , is a network of ""salvagers"" with business ties to ""transportation"" and ""waste disposal""."
sublight_02	A tangled web of contractors and secretive vice presidents make up their official hierarchy,
sublight_03	leaving no one to speak on the record about SubLight's more legally dubious activities.
sublight_04	SubLight as a business operates activities that would be considered illicit by some,
sublight_05	amoral by others,
sublight_06	and at odds with the Board,
sublight_07	such as the takeover of abandoned space habitats,
sublight_08	smuggling contraband,
sublight_09	and serving as a front for companies to bypass the infamous Hazard Clause applied on Monarch.
sublight_10	According to director Lilya Hagen,
sublight_11	operating off of Groundbreaker,
sublight_12	"SubLight ""occupies a legal blind spot."
sublight_13	No one knows what [they're] licensed to do,
sublight_14	"and that gives [their] little business some freedom."""
sublight_15	Although the Board tolerates and sees the value of SubLight's activities,
sublight_16	there are still limits to what the latter can get away with.
sublight_17	SubLight maintains an office aboard the Groundbreaker as well as a settlement on Monarch known as Fallbrook.
