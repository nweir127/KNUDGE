O7_B1	returning to Ms. Jolicoeur,
O7_B2	the player will find her dead,
O7_B3	in the middle of her store.
O7_B4	A Corporate Commander will instruct the player to stand back.
O7_B5	Pressing further reveals that whatever the Chimaera was supposed to look like,
O7_B6	was not in fact legal in Byzantium.
O7_B7	As such, being caught red handed with the garment in her possession,
O7_B8	an attempt at her arrest was made by the Corporate Troopers,
O7_B9	but unfortunately for her, she didn't feel like cooperating,
O7_B10	and the guards didn't feel like negotiating,
O7_B11	so they shot her.
O7_B12	The player has the option to accuse the Trooper of murder and attack,
O7_B13	but this understandably a bad idea being that this individual is a high ranking member of Byzantium's Police Force.
O7_B14	The other option is to simply call them insane,
O7_B15	in which case they say UDL's motto, and walk off.

byzantium_02	All the opulence, elegance, and decadence of the colony is concentrated in the city.
byzantium_03	Its residents are colloquially referred to as gold-bloods.
byzantium_04	"Referred to as the ""gilded city of the well-to-do"","
byzantium_05	Byzantium is where every Halcyon colonist wishes they could live.
byzantium_06	The city is closed off to those without the means to be appropriate residents;
byzantium_07	itâ€™s a literal gated community with secrets that lesser company workers will simply never learn.

byzantium_09	with streets and docking bays encircling the Halcyon Holdings Corporation headquarters,
byzantium_10	located in the restricted Acropolis District.

byzantium_12	and are built in a futuristic Art Nouveau style,
byzantium_13	as opposed to the simpler prefabricated frontier designs of Edgewater or Stellar Bay.
byzantium_14	The Acropolis District is a wealthy district for the most prominent citizens of both Byzantium and the entire Halcyon Colony.
byzantium_15	Located here are the headquarters of the Halcyon Holdings Corporation,

celeste_jolicoeur_04	She will send the player on a quest to bring back outfits and materials she needs to create the player a unique and one-of-a-kind outfit, the Chimaera.

groundbreaker	
groundbreaker_01	UDL-001 The Groundbreaker or simply Groundbreaker was the first colony ship to arrive in Halcyon during the Crossing.
groundbreaker_02	By 2355, it has been converted into an independent orbital station,
groundbreaker_03	and is the only place in the entire Halcyon system that is not controlled by the Halcyon Holdings Corporate Board or any other corporation.
groundbreaker_04	The crew of the Groundbreaker is fiercely protective of their independence from the corporations,
groundbreaker_05	and the corporations value the station's role as a thriving freeport enough that they are willing to deal with it on relatively equal terms.
groundbreaker_06	In practical terms, while the Groundbreaker rules itself,
groundbreaker_07	it cooperates with the corporations to an extent,
groundbreaker_08	such as by impounding ships that the Board happens to flag.
groundbreaker_09	The Groundbreaker is commanded by engineer-turned-captain Junlei Tennyson.
groundbreaker_10	Udom Bedford is the Halcyon Holdings Corporation representative stationed aboard.
groundbreaker_11	According to Junlei, lots of corners were cut when the ship was built,
groundbreaker_12	prompting Captain Guiying Tennyson to spend half of her career attempting to patch the ship back together after the Crossing from Earth to Halcyon.
groundbreaker_13	In addition, the ship has tinkerings and bypasses that only the Tennysons know about.
groundbreaker_14	The Groundbreaker maintains a somewhat tense relationship with the Board,
groundbreaker_15	owing to their declared independence from Board authority,
groundbreaker_16	as well as their control of shipping routes outward from the Halcyon System.
groundbreaker_17	Nonetheless, given that Groundbreaker lacks any semblance of military might against the Board beyond the mardets stationed aboard the ship,
groundbreaker_18	the loose hierarchy in charge of the Groundbreaker often seeks to find (illicit) ways of delaying, stymieing, or pitting corporations under the Board's thumb against each other,
groundbreaker_19	usually through black market fences like Gladys Culkelly.
groundbreaker_20	Nonetheless, the Board maintains an embassy aboard the Groundbreaker run by bureaucrat Udom Bedford.
groundbreaker_21	Depending on the actions of the Stranger, the Groundbreaker's crew may be compelled to rebel against the Board's system-wide authority.
groundbreaker_22	The Groundbreaker is generally neutral to Sublight Salvage and Shipping Corporation,
groundbreaker_23	and allows them to operate an office and warehouse aboard the ship, helmed by Lilya Hagen.

iconoclasts_04	Based in the ruins of the Amber Heights settlement on Monarch,
iconoclasts_05	they are a tenacious group,
iconoclasts_06	and share some democratic ideals with Monarch Stellar Industries (MSI) against the more repressive actions of the Board.
iconoclasts_07	However, the Iconoclast's anti-corporate nature has put them at odds with MSI, a dispute that threatens to spill into all-out warfare.
iconoclasts_08	Given that the Iconoclasts are mostly followers of the Philosophist faith, they have been blacklisted and demonized by the Board as dissenters and anarchists.
iconoclasts_09	The group is led by Graham Bryant, a staunch Philosophist.
iconoclasts_10	Zora Blackwood, the Iconoclasts' chief of medicine, is also considered a de facto leader of the group,
iconoclasts_11	as she was alongside Graham when he founded the Iconoclasts,
iconoclasts_12	and almost every member of the Iconoclasts owes her their life in some way.
iconoclasts_13	The Iconoclasts maintain a tense relationship with MSI.
iconoclasts_14	Despite sharing democratic values and a common desire towards egalitarianism for the people of Monarch and the wider Halcyon colony,
iconoclasts_15	"MSI's ""egalitarian corporate structure"" has proven to be at odds with some of the Iconoclasts' more radical, anti-capitalist views."
iconoclasts_16	Depending on the actions of the Stranger, this tense relationship can either be resolved,
iconoclasts_17	or can spill into a drawn-out and bloody war.
iconoclasts_18	The Stranger meets the Iconoclasts in Amber Heights just as the tension between them and MSI is reaching boiling point.
iconoclasts_19	They can either side with the Iconoclasts and assist them in storming and taking over Stellar Bay,
iconoclasts_20	"""solve"" the Iconoclast problem for Stellar Bay,"
iconoclasts_21	or broker peace between the two factions.
iconoclasts_22	The Stranger can also have an impact on the leadership of the Iconoclasts - siding with either Graham Bryant or Zora Blackwood.
iconoclasts_23	To supplant Graham with Zora, evidence of Graham's involvement in the Amber Heights massacre must be found and presented to Zora.
iconoclasts_24	The Van Noys are the Iconoclasts' best unit.

monarch	
monarch_01	Monarch, previously known as Terra 1, is one of the many moons of the gas giant Olympus and the site of a failed colony.
monarch_02	Terra 1 was initially designated as the primary colonization target of the Halcyon system.
monarch_03	The Halcyon Holdings Corporate Board had intended to completely terraform the moon,
monarch_04	wiping out the local fauna and flora and replacing it with plants and wildlife native to Earth.
monarch_05	However, the terraforming process unexpectedly caused the native species to mutate and grow to significantly larger sizes,
monarch_06	rendering them more dangerous and severely crippling the colonization effort.
monarch_07	Due to the hostile environment which they had created,
monarch_08	the Board was forced to enact a Hazard Clause covering the entirety of Terra 1.
monarch_09	Public notice of the clause's issuance was sent to everyone operating on Terra 1 and led to the evacuation of almost all corporations from the moon.
monarch_10	However, one corporation took advantage of the chaos of the evacuation to exploit a legal loophole which allowed them to,
monarch_11	as the last corporation remaining on the planet,
monarch_12	acquire the planet from the Board.
monarch_13	This corporation, under the leadership of Sanjar Nandi and Graham Bryant subsequently rebranded itself to Monarch Stellar Industries (MSI),
monarch_14	in line with the renaming of the planet to 'Monarch'.
monarch_15	The actions of MSI earned them the ire of the Board,
monarch_16	who retaliated by effectively placing the moon under indefinite embargo,
monarch_17	refusing to allow legal transit either in or out.
monarch_18	the Board aggressively spread propaganda about Monarch to convince the rest of the population that it was both uninhabited and uninhabitable.
monarch_19	This has greatly hampered MSI's attempts to be recognized as a legitimate corporation and is a thorn in the side of its CEO, Sanjar Nandi.
monarch_20	"Monarch also has an ocean which goes around the moon at the ""twilight band""."
monarch_21	It is where the colonists and Monarch Stellar Industries farm their saltuna.

raptidon_03	however some corporations have illegally imported them to other planets,
raptidon_04	such as Auntie Cleo who relocated a group of them to Roseway.
