commandant_sanita	
commandant_sanita_01	Commandant Sanita is the head of security on Groundbreaker.
commandant_sanita_02	Commandant Sanita takes her security duties seriously and is not easily diverted into conversations with passersby.
commandant_sanita_03	She expects the same from her subordinates and will reprimand them for unprofessional behavior,
commandant_sanita_04	such as chatting too much while on duty.
commandant_sanita_05	She is only concerned with affairs on Groundbreaker and as long as someone has no infractions on the station,
commandant_sanita_06	she has no problems with them,
commandant_sanita_07	regardless of their relationship with the Board.
groundbreaker	
groundbreaker_01	UDL-001 The Groundbreaker or simply Groundbreaker was the first colony ship to arrive in Halcyon during the Crossing.
groundbreaker_02	By 2355, it has been converted into an independent orbital station,
groundbreaker_03	and is the only place in the entire Halcyon system that is not controlled by the Halcyon Holdings Corporate Board or any other corporation.
groundbreaker_04	The crew of the Groundbreaker is fiercely protective of their independence from the corporations,
groundbreaker_05	and the corporations value the station's role as a thriving freeport enough that they are willing to deal with it on relatively equal terms.
groundbreaker_06	In practical terms, while the Groundbreaker rules itself,
groundbreaker_07	it cooperates with the corporations to an extent,
groundbreaker_08	such as by impounding ships that the Board happens to flag.
groundbreaker_09	The Groundbreaker is commanded by engineer-turned-captain Junlei Tennyson.
groundbreaker_10	Udom Bedford is the Halcyon Holdings Corporation representative stationed aboard.
groundbreaker_11	According to Junlei, lots of corners were cut when the ship was built,
groundbreaker_12	prompting Captain Guiying Tennyson to spend half of her career attempting to patch the ship back together after the Crossing from Earth to Halcyon.
groundbreaker_13	In addition, the ship has tinkerings and bypasses that only the Tennysons know about.
groundbreaker_14	The Groundbreaker maintains a somewhat tense relationship with the Board,
groundbreaker_15	owing to their declared independence from Board authority,
groundbreaker_16	as well as their control of shipping routes outward from the Halcyon System.
groundbreaker_17	Nonetheless, given that Groundbreaker lacks any semblance of military might against the Board beyond the mardets stationed aboard the ship,
groundbreaker_18	the loose hierarchy in charge of the Groundbreaker often seeks to find (illicit) ways of delaying, stymieing, or pitting corporations under the Board's thumb against each other,
groundbreaker_19	usually through black market fences like Gladys Culkelly.
groundbreaker_20	Nonetheless, the Board maintains an embassy aboard the Groundbreaker run by bureaucrat Udom Bedford.
groundbreaker_21	Depending on the actions of the Stranger, the Groundbreaker's crew may be compelled to rebel against the Board's system-wide authority.
groundbreaker_22	The Groundbreaker is generally neutral to Sublight Salvage and Shipping Corporation,
groundbreaker_23	and allows them to operate an office and warehouse aboard the ship, helmed by Lilya Hagen.
gunnar_macredd	
gunnar_macredd_01	Captain Gunnar MacRedd is a known criminal and leader of a group of outlaws found in the Back Bays of Groundbreaker.
gunnar_macredd_02	"MacRedd is a pyromaniac with a criminal record which includes ""several counts of flying under the influence,"
gunnar_macredd_03	carrying open alcoholic containers,
gunnar_macredd_04	failure to pay docking fees,
gunnar_macredd_05	resisting arrest,
gunnar_macredd_06	"and assaulting not one but two officers."""
gunnar_macredd_07	"He has a lighter which he claims was given to him by Commandant Sanita a few years back when the two had a ""carnal understanding""."
gunnar_macredd_08	"However, Sanita claims that this understanding only consisted of her ""kick[ing] his ass from one end of the Groundbreaker to the other""."
junlei_tennyson	
junlei_tennyson_01	Junlei Tennyson is a self described engineer-turned-captain and is the leader of Groundbreaker,
junlei_tennyson_02	the only community in Halcyon operating outside The Board's control.
junlei_tennyson_03	She harbours a strong dislike for the Board due to their continued attempts to exert control over Groundbreaker,
junlei_tennyson_04	and because she believes they are only after two things—bits and power—which they get by sticking their nose where it doesn't belong.
junlei_tennyson_05	She considers the Mardets, crew, and engineers of Groundbreaker to be family.
junlei_tennyson_06	Junlei Tennyson is the third generation of Tennyson leadership aboard Groundbreaker,
junlei_tennyson_07	recently promoted from chief engineer to captain after the death of her mother.
junlei_tennyson_08	She was close to her mother but frequently argued with her father over how Groundbreaker should be run.
junlei_tennyson_09	Junlei was previously in a relationship with a woman named Isabelle who tried and failed to earn the approval of Junlei's father.
junlei_tennyson_10	They continued seeing each other anyway,
junlei_tennyson_11	but the relationship eventually ended poorly.
junlei_tennyson_12	Junlei can be found in her office in Groundbreaker Engineering.
junlei_tennyson_13	She introduces herself to the Stranger as captain of Groundbreaker,
junlei_tennyson_14	and notes that her friends call her Chief.
junlei_tennyson_15	The explanation she gives for the formal introduction is that Groundbreaker doesn't see many visitors.
junlei_tennyson_16	Junlei then goes on to make it clear that she has the final say on the ship,
junlei_tennyson_17	and welcomes the Stranger on board as they seem to be different to the usual outsiders who are mostly 'Board spies and corporate sprats'.
junlei_tennyson_18	If the player asks Junlei about the heat problem on Groundbreaker,
junlei_tennyson_19	they can offer to help her obtain new radiator parts.
junlei_tennyson_20	After the radiator parts are installed,
junlei_tennyson_21	more dialogue options become available to ask her about herself and Groundbreaker.
junlei_tennyson_22	She will also direct the player to Edna Ingmire to help her with a comms issue,
junlei_tennyson_23	and inform the player that they are now authorized to trade with Doctor Mfuru.
junlei_tennyson_24	Junlei will appear on the Unreliable if the player helps to set up a date between her and Parvati.
junlei_tennyson_25	When interacted with, she thanks them for welcoming her aboard the ship.
mardets	
mardets_01	The Mardets or Groundbreaker Security are the security force on the Groundbreaker.
mardets_02	The Mardets started as the original security force on Groundbreaker before the Crossing.
mardets_03	The original force was made up of a marine detachment from the 77th Marine Expeditionary Unit, Trailward Fleet.
mardets_04	Over time people started to call them Mardets because it was easier to say and the name stuck.
mardets_05	The Mardets that currently protect Groundbreaker are descended from the original marine detachment and still wear colony ship guard armor as a uniform.
sublight	
sublight_01	"The SubLight Salvage and Shipping Corporation, also known as SubLight Salvage and Shipping or simply SubLight , is a network of ""salvagers"" with business ties to ""transportation"" and ""waste disposal""."
sublight_02	A tangled web of contractors and secretive vice presidents make up their official hierarchy,
sublight_03	leaving no one to speak on the record about SubLight's more legally dubious activities.
sublight_04	SubLight as a business operates activities that would be considered illicit by some,
sublight_05	amoral by others,
sublight_06	and at odds with the Board,
sublight_07	such as the takeover of abandoned space habitats,
sublight_08	smuggling contraband,
sublight_09	and serving as a front for companies to bypass the infamous Hazard Clause applied on Monarch.
sublight_10	According to director Lilya Hagen,
sublight_11	operating off of Groundbreaker,
sublight_12	"SubLight ""occupies a legal blind spot."
sublight_13	No one knows what [they're] licensed to do,
sublight_14	"and that gives [their] little business some freedom."""
sublight_15	Although the Board tolerates and sees the value of SubLight's activities,
sublight_16	there are still limits to what the latter can get away with.
sublight_17	SubLight maintains an office aboard the Groundbreaker as well as a settlement on Monarch known as Fallbrook.
