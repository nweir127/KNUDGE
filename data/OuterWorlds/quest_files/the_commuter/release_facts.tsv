amber_heights	
amber_heights_01	Amber Heights is a location in the Monarch Wilderness and the base of operations for the Iconoclasts.
amber_heights_02	The Iconoclasts run the place somewhat like a commune.
amber_heights_03	Amber Heights was once the place of residence of the entire executive dome of Monarch Stellar Industries.
amber_heights_04	It is now in ruins after a massacre in the past.
amber_heights_05	They lived there with their families and it was the company's operations center on Monarch.
amber_heights_06	Just after The Board approved the evacuation of the planet through the Hazard Clause, Amber Heights was besieged by a gang of pirates who ransacked the town and massacred all its inhabitants.
amber_heights_07	"This tragedy was known as ""The Amber Heights Massacre""."
amber_heights_08	They were secretly assisted by MSI employee, Graham Bryant, who believed that the massacre would aid him in his quest to rid the colony of corporate influence.
amber_heights_09	In 2345, the same Graham Bryant formed the Iconoclasts and settled the group in the deserted town.
carlotta	
carlotta_01	Carlotta is a resident of Stellar Bay and an Iconoclasts sympathizer.
carlotta_02	She can be found in the Bayside Terrace Warehouse after starting the quest, The Commuter.
carlotta_03	She is behind a sealed door and will open it if spoken to using the intercom.
carlotta_04	Carlotta envies the freedom enjoyed by the Iconoclasts and respects Graham Bryant for his dedication to living a life separate from the corporations,
carlotta_05	even though she herself requires structure and could not adapt to their way of living.
carlotta_06	She has been secretly supplying the Iconoclasts, buying supplies from Stellar Bay on their behalf, despite the group's disagreements with MSI.
carlotta_07	However, she has recently grown tired of sticking her neck out for them and would have stopped trading with them even if Sanjar Nandi hadn't made it illegal.
graham_bryant	
graham_bryant_01	Graham Bryant is the leader of the Iconoclasts on Monarch.
graham_bryant_02	Graham used to work for MSI, before splitting off and forming the Iconoclasts
graham_bryant_03	When the Hazard Clause was invoked and the evacuation of Monarch began, he and fellow MSI executive, Sanjar Nandi were informed by Hiram Blythe about a loophole which would allow for MSI to take full control of the planet.
graham_bryant_04	Graham and Sanjar believed that this provided them with an opportunity to dismantle the corporate system, even if they had different interpretations of this intention.
graham_bryant_05	However, they were unable to convince the other MSI executives of their plan, so Graham made an arrangement to remove this hurdle.
graham_bryant_06	Graham informed a crew of pirates about the wealth that could be found in Amber Heights and provided them with the gate access codes to break into the settlement.
graham_bryant_07	On the night of the pirate attack, Graham slept safe in Stellar Bay, while the rest of his colleagues were being massacred.
graham_bryant_08	Graham's frustration with the inaction made him desperate.
graham_bryant_09	He informed a crew of pirates about the wealth that could be found in Amber Heights and provided them with the gate access codes to break into the settlement.
graham_bryant_10	Even as the Iconoclasts settled in Amber Heights,
graham_bryant_11	Graham was reluctant to speak of the events that happened there.
graham_bryant_12	This was interpreted by his followers as grief over the loss of his former colleagues.
graham_bryant_13	His true reaction to the events that happened ranged from guilt to denial to belief that his actions were ultimately justified.
graham_bryant_14	After the Amber Heights massacre, Sanjar took over ownership of MSI, something which Graham viewed as a betrayal of the ideals which he believed motivated them both.
graham_bryant_15	As leader of the Iconoclasts, Graham prioritised the spreading of Philosophism to the rest of Halcyon,
graham_bryant_16	using the Devil's Peak Station broadcast channel to hijack Halcyon News Network's programming on locations including Groundbreaker
graham_bryant_17	and spending Iconoclast resources on securing a printing press which would allow them to better disseminate their message.
graham_bryant_18	This has led to disagreements between Graham and his second-in-charge, Zora Blackwood, who disapproved of prioritising evangelism over the welfare of their people.
graham_bryant_19	If the Stranger investigates the pasts of both Graham Bryant and Zora Blackwood,
graham_bryant_20	Blackwood can be led to believe that she must supplant Graham as Iconoclast leader,
graham_bryant_21	based on his actions amid the infamous Amber Heights massacre.
graham_bryant_22	Graham can't be persuaded to accept this move, and must be killed to make room for Blackwood.
graham_bryant_23	These events can enable the establishment of an Iconoclast-MSI alliance.
iconoclasts	
iconoclasts_01	The Iconoclasts are a group of survivalists living in the ruins of Amber Heights on Monarch.
iconoclasts_02	They hope to one day tear down the corporate establishment that they believe has brought the colony to the brink of death.
iconoclasts_03	The Iconoclasts are a group of idealistic revolutionaries that seek to overthrow the corporate establishment that runs the Halcyon Colony.
iconoclasts_04	Based in the ruins of the Amber Heights settlement on Monarch,
iconoclasts_05	they are a tenacious group,
iconoclasts_06	and share some democratic ideals with Monarch Stellar Industries (MSI) against the more repressive actions of the Board.
iconoclasts_07	However, the Iconoclast's anti-corporate nature has put them at odds with MSI, a dispute that threatens to spill into all-out warfare.
iconoclasts_08	Given that the Iconoclasts are mostly followers of the Philosophist faith, they have been blacklisted and demonized by the Board as dissenters and anarchists.
iconoclasts_09	The group is led by Graham Bryant, a staunch Philosophist.
iconoclasts_10	Zora Blackwood, the Iconoclasts' chief of medicine, is also considered a de facto leader of the group,
iconoclasts_11	as she was alongside Graham when he founded the Iconoclasts,
iconoclasts_12	and almost every member of the Iconoclasts owes her their life in some way.
iconoclasts_13	The Iconoclasts maintain a tense relationship with MSI.
iconoclasts_14	Despite sharing democratic values and a common desire towards egalitarianism for the people of Monarch and the wider Halcyon colony,
iconoclasts_15	"MSI's ""egalitarian corporate structure"" has proven to be at odds with some of the Iconoclasts' more radical, anti-capitalist views."
iconoclasts_16	Depending on the actions of the Stranger, this tense relationship can either be resolved,
iconoclasts_17	or can spill into a drawn-out and bloody war.
iconoclasts_18	The Stranger meets the Iconoclasts in Amber Heights just as the tension between them and MSI is reaching boiling point.
iconoclasts_19	They can either side with the Iconoclasts and assist them in storming and taking over Stellar Bay,
iconoclasts_20	"""solve"" the Iconoclast problem for Stellar Bay,"
iconoclasts_21	or broker peace between the two factions.
iconoclasts_22	The Stranger can also have an impact on the leadership of the Iconoclasts - siding with either Graham Bryant or Zora Blackwood.
iconoclasts_23	To supplant Graham with Zora, evidence of Graham's involvement in the Amber Heights massacre must be found and presented to Zora.
iconoclasts_24	The Van Noys are the Iconoclasts' best unit.
monarch_stellar_industries	
monarch_stellar_industries_01	Monarch Stellar Industries (MSI) is a corporation based on Monarch.
monarch_stellar_industries_02	Once a loyal Board-owned corporation, Monarch Stellar Industries split off to become their own private entity under the leadership of Sanjar Nandi.
monarch_stellar_industries_03	Espousing worker-centric rights and democratic ideals, Sanjar seeks to bring his own brand of freedom to the rest of Halcyon.
monarch_stellar_industries_04	MSI farms saltuna on Monarch.
monarch_stellar_industries_05	Following the failed terraforming of Monarch and the abandonment of other corporations due to the imposition of the Hazard Clause,
monarch_stellar_industries_06	the precursor to Monarch Stellar took advantage of a legal loophole to acquire possession of Monarch and re-branded their corporation to match that of their newest asset.
monarch_stellar_industries_07	Monarch Stellar's acquisition of the planet earned the ire of the Board,
monarch_stellar_industries_08	due to the loss of their asset and as such enforced an embargo on Monarch.
monarch_stellar_industries_09	MSI as a corporation espouses a more egalitarian philosophy than the other companies on The Board, valuing the rights and individual liberties of its workers and employees.
monarch_stellar_industries_10	However, the violent and wild ecosystem of Monarch, coupled with the pressure applied from the Board-authorized Hazard Clause, have forced MSI to cut corners in their attempt at survival.
monarch_stellar_industries_11	MSI maintains a tense relationship with the revolutionary band of survivalists known as the Iconoclasts,
monarch_stellar_industries_12	in part due to the Iconoclasts believing in total anti-corporate ideals,
monarch_stellar_industries_13	as opposed to MSI's more corporate-egalitarian views.
monarch_stellar_industries_14	Depending on the actions of the Stranger, the tense relationship can spill out into warfare, or be resolved peacefully.
monarch_stellar_industries_15	The Board maintains a very tense relationship with MSI, owing to MSI's democratic ideals and their declared ownership of Monarch.
monarch_stellar_industries_16	As a result, the Board has placed Monarch, and by extension, MSI, under the Hazard Clause, which forbids off-world businesses from doing transactions on Monarch without the correct (and deliberately impossible to complete) documents.
philosophists	
philosophists_01	The Philosophists are one of two main religious groups in Halcyon.
philosophists_02	Philosophists seek to maintain a natural flow with the universe.
philosophists_03	Their beliefs have earned them the ire of the corporations, which officially practice and enforce Scientism.
philosophists_04	At the core of Philosophism is the belief that the universe was created in an organic and natural way without any specific purpose.
philosophists_05	"Two of the most important concepts of Philosophism are the ""Awakening"" and the ""Eternal Truth""."
philosophists_06	The Eternal Truth is the ability to be part of the consciousness of the cosmos and to fulfill the role that the universe has given people in its eternal quest to understand itself.
philosophists_07	Coming to understand and be part of that journey is what makes any being divine.
philosophists_08	The Awakening is the point of no return.
philosophists_09	It is the moment when the mind opens to the Eternal Truth.
philosophists_10	It is the experience that any Philosophist goes through and that can come from different vital experiences such as witnessing the death of a loved one.
philosophists_11	Philosophism opposes corporate materialism.
sanjar_nandi	
sanjar_nandi_01	Sanjar Nandi is the current CEO of Monarch Stellar Industries, based in Stellar Bay.
sanjar_nandi_02	Sanjar began working for MSI at a young age and it was there where he met Graham Bryant, who would eventually become his best friend.
sanjar_nandi_03	Sanjar was ambitious but his attention to detail at the expense of big-picture thinking hampered his efforts within MSI.
sanjar_nandi_04	This led to negative performance reviews regarding his tendency to pad reports and talks with numbers and data,
sanjar_nandi_05	feedback which continues to haunt him many years on.
sanjar_nandi_06	However, the negative feedback did not dampen Sanjar's desire to move up within the company,
sanjar_nandi_07	even donating a kidney to one of the executives in hopes of promotion.
sanjar_nandi_08	Despite his poor performance, Sanjar always showed himself to be a loyal employee of the company.
sanjar_nandi_09	Despite Sanjar's best efforts, he has found it extremely challenging to continue operating MSI on Monarch without the backing of the Board.
sanjar_nandi_10	In order to improve the lives of the people he is responsible for, Sanjar has a plan to rejoin the Board through the use of a BOLT-52 form and proof of another corporate presence on Monarch.
sanjar_nandi_11	He is simultaneously working on a plan to reorganize the Board,
sanjar_nandi_12	hoping that his plans are not found out until MSI has been reinstated.
sanjar_nandi_13	Sanjar choosing to take over as head of MSI rather than dismantling it entirely caused a rift between him and Graham Bryant.
sanjar_nandi_14	The latter started the Iconoclasts,
sanjar_nandi_15	a group dedicated to spreading the word of Philosophism throughout the galaxy,
sanjar_nandi_16	and Sanjar was left in Stellar Bay to run the company and look after the employees who were left behind.
sanjar_nandi_17	He can also tell you more about the planet, that used to be called Terra 1
sanjar_nandi_18	and the reform that he and Monarch Stellar Industries tried to achieve to give more humane working conditions for everyone within.

sublight_02	A tangled web of contractors and secretive vice presidents make up their official hierarchy,
sublight_03	leaving no one to speak on the record about SubLight's more legally dubious activities.
sublight_04	SubLight as a business operates activities that would be considered illicit by some,
sublight_05	amoral by others,
sublight_06	and at odds with the Board,
sublight_07	such as the takeover of abandoned space habitats,
sublight_08	smuggling contraband,
sublight_09	and serving as a front for companies to bypass the infamous Hazard Clause applied on Monarch.
sublight_10	According to director Lilya Hagen,
sublight_11	operating off of Groundbreaker,
sublight_12	"SubLight ""occupies a legal blind spot."
sublight_13	No one knows what [they're] licensed to do,
sublight_14	"and that gives [their] little business some freedom."""
sublight_15	Although the Board tolerates and sees the value of SubLight's activities,
sublight_16	there are still limits to what the latter can get away with.
sublight_17	SubLight maintains an office aboard the Groundbreaker as well as a settlement on Monarch known as Fallbrook.
terra_one_publications

terra_one_publications_02	The facility was responsible for printing a variety of different publications including the Dissident Hunter series.
terra_one_publications_03	When the Stranger lands on Monarch, Graham Bryant plans to reclaim the facility in hopes of using it to print propaganda for the Iconoclasts.

zora_blackwood_04	She joined Graham Bryant and helped start the Iconoclasts, patching up those who got wounded while fighting for their cause.
zora_blackwood_05	Nearly every member of the Iconoclasts owes her their life in some way.
zora_blackwood_06	However, her methods of operation including her desire to impose some form of scheduling on the faction, has ruffled some feathers.
zora_blackwood_07	This has led to conflicts between herself and Graham Bryant, the latter being more focused on spreading the message of Philosophism
zora_blackwood_08	Graham considers Zora's concerns about food and medicine to be a distracting attachment to corporate materialism.
zora_blackwood_09	Zora values the lives of the Van Noys more than securing the printing press
zora_blackwood_10	Zora does not know that Graham Bryant helped aid in the Amber Heights Massacre
zora_blackwood_11	Before joining the Iconoclasts, Zora lived in Cascadia and worked for Rizzo's in the bottling plant as a doctor.
zora_blackwood_12	"She was an excellent employee and described as a ""top-notch sawbones with a good head for working under pressure""."
zora_blackwood_13	The Stranger can back Zora in taking over as leader of the Iconoclasts and either brokering peace with Stellar Bay or defeating MSI.
zora_blackwood_14	If the player sides with MSI, they will be tasked with killing her.
zora_blackwood_15	If the player earns her trust, they can instead convince her to make peace with MSI.
