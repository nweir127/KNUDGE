celia_robbins_03	just as an excuse to talk to him.
celia_robbins_04	Unfortunately her apartment is filling up with exotic creature parts and her neighbors are starting to complain about the smell.
celia_robbins_05	She is not concerned that she and Sebastian may not have much to talk about,
celia_robbins_06	as everyone else in Stellar Bay either smells like saltuna or are her boss.

monarch_stellar_industries	
monarch_stellar_industries_01	Monarch Stellar Industries (MSI) is a corporation based on Monarch.
monarch_stellar_industries_02	Once a loyal Board-owned corporation, Monarch Stellar Industries split off to become their own private entity under the leadership of Sanjar Nandi.
monarch_stellar_industries_03	Espousing worker-centric rights and democratic ideals, Sanjar seeks to bring his own brand of freedom to the rest of Halcyon.
monarch_stellar_industries_04	MSI farms saltuna on Monarch.
monarch_stellar_industries_05	Following the failed terraforming of Monarch and the abandonment of other corporations due to the imposition of the Hazard Clause,
monarch_stellar_industries_06	the precursor to Monarch Stellar took advantage of a legal loophole to acquire possession of Monarch and re-branded their corporation to match that of their newest asset.
monarch_stellar_industries_07	Monarch Stellar's acquisition of the planet earned the ire of the Board,
monarch_stellar_industries_08	due to the loss of their asset and as such enforced an embargo on Monarch.
monarch_stellar_industries_09	MSI as a corporation espouses a more egalitarian philosophy than the other companies on The Board, valuing the rights and individual liberties of its workers and employees.
monarch_stellar_industries_10	However, the violent and wild ecosystem of Monarch, coupled with the pressure applied from the Board-authorized Hazard Clause, have forced MSI to cut corners in their attempt at survival.
monarch_stellar_industries_11	MSI maintains a tense relationship with the revolutionary band of survivalists known as the Iconoclasts,
monarch_stellar_industries_12	in part due to the Iconoclasts believing in total anti-corporate ideals,
monarch_stellar_industries_13	as opposed to MSI's more corporate-egalitarian views.
monarch_stellar_industries_14	Depending on the actions of the Stranger, the tense relationship can spill out into warfare, or be resolved peacefully.
monarch_stellar_industries_15	The Board maintains a very tense relationship with MSI, owing to MSI's democratic ideals and their declared ownership of Monarch.
monarch_stellar_industries_16	As a result, the Board has placed Monarch, and by extension, MSI, under the Hazard Clause, which forbids off-world businesses from doing transactions on Monarch without the correct (and deliberately impossible to complete) documents.

sanjar_nandi_02	Sanjar began working for MSI at a young age and it was there where he met Graham Bryant, who would eventually become his best friend.
sanjar_nandi_03	Sanjar was ambitious but his attention to detail at the expense of big-picture thinking hampered his efforts within MSI.
sanjar_nandi_04	This led to negative performance reviews regarding his tendency to pad reports and talks with numbers and data,
sanjar_nandi_05	feedback which continues to haunt him many years on.
sanjar_nandi_06	However, the negative feedback did not dampen Sanjar's desire to move up within the company,
sanjar_nandi_07	even donating a kidney to one of the executives in hopes of promotion.
sanjar_nandi_08	Despite his poor performance, Sanjar always showed himself to be a loyal employee of the company.
sanjar_nandi_09	Despite Sanjar's best efforts, he has found it extremely challenging to continue operating MSI on Monarch without the backing of the Board.
sanjar_nandi_10	In order to improve the lives of the people he is responsible for, Sanjar has a plan to rejoin the Board through the use of a BOLT-52 form and proof of another corporate presence on Monarch.
sanjar_nandi_11	He is simultaneously working on a plan to reorganize the Board,
sanjar_nandi_12	hoping that his plans are not found out until MSI has been reinstated.
sanjar_nandi_13	Sanjar choosing to take over as head of MSI rather than dismantling it entirely caused a rift between him and Graham Bryant.
sanjar_nandi_14	The latter started the Iconoclasts,
sanjar_nandi_15	a group dedicated to spreading the word of Philosophism throughout the galaxy,
sanjar_nandi_16	and Sanjar was left in Stellar Bay to run the company and look after the employees who were left behind.
