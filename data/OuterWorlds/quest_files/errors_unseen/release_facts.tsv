catherine_malin	
catherine_malin_01	Catherine Malin is the outpost administrator of Fallbrook and owner of Malin's House of Hospitality.
catherine_malin_02	"Catherine, acting on behalf of SubLight Salvage and Shipping Corporation, is the ""top dog"" in Fallbrook, and a mastermind behind it's construction."
catherine_malin_03	She is known for a violent temper and won't hesitate to hire a hitman to get somebody whacked.
catherine_malin_04	Sanjar Nandi is afraid of Catherine.
catherine_malin_05	According to him, she has certain ambitions for Stellar Bay and Sanjar fears asking her for help during Errors Unseen because it may give her the leverage she has been looking for.
catherine_malin_06	Celia, his assistant, tries to calm him down and says it's perfectly normal to have a healthy fear of her.
celia_robbins	
celia_robbins_01	Celia Robbins is a middle manager for Monarch Stellar Industries and works with Sanjar Nandi at MSI Headquarters in Stellar Bay.
celia_robbins_02	Celia has a crush on Sebastian Adams and will buy whatever he has in stock,
celia_robbins_03	just as an excuse to talk to him.
celia_robbins_04	Unfortunately her apartment is filling up with exotic creature parts and her neighbors are starting to complain about the smell.
celia_robbins_05	She is not concerned that she and Sebastian may not have much to talk about,
celia_robbins_06	as everyone else in Stellar Bay either smells like saltuna or are her boss.
celia_robbins_07	The Stranger can offer to set her and Sebastian up on a date.
monarch_stellar_industries	
monarch_stellar_industries_01	Monarch Stellar Industries (MSI) is a corporation based on Monarch.
monarch_stellar_industries_02	Once a loyal Board-owned corporation, Monarch Stellar Industries split off to become their own private entity under the leadership of Sanjar Nandi.
monarch_stellar_industries_03	Espousing worker-centric rights and democratic ideals, Sanjar seeks to bring his own brand of freedom to the rest of Halcyon.
monarch_stellar_industries_04	MSI farms saltuna on Monarch.
monarch_stellar_industries_05	Following the failed terraforming of Monarch and the abandonment of other corporations due to the imposition of the Hazard Clause,
monarch_stellar_industries_06	the precursor to Monarch Stellar took advantage of a legal loophole to acquire possession of Monarch and re-branded their corporation to match that of their newest asset.
monarch_stellar_industries_07	Monarch Stellar's acquisition of the planet earned the ire of the Board,
monarch_stellar_industries_08	due to the loss of their asset and as such enforced an embargo on Monarch.
monarch_stellar_industries_09	MSI as a corporation espouses a more egalitarian philosophy than the other companies on The Board, valuing the rights and individual liberties of its workers and employees.
monarch_stellar_industries_10	However, the violent and wild ecosystem of Monarch, coupled with the pressure applied from the Board-authorized Hazard Clause, have forced MSI to cut corners in their attempt at survival.
monarch_stellar_industries_11	MSI maintains a tense relationship with the revolutionary band of survivalists known as the Iconoclasts,
monarch_stellar_industries_12	in part due to the Iconoclasts believing in total anti-corporate ideals,
monarch_stellar_industries_13	as opposed to MSI's more corporate-egalitarian views.
monarch_stellar_industries_14	Depending on the actions of the Stranger, the tense relationship can spill out into warfare, or be resolved peacefully.
monarch_stellar_industries_15	The Board maintains a very tense relationship with MSI, owing to MSI's democratic ideals and their declared ownership of Monarch.
monarch_stellar_industries_16	As a result, the Board has placed Monarch, and by extension, MSI, under the Hazard Clause, which forbids off-world businesses from doing transactions on Monarch without the correct (and deliberately impossible to complete) documents.
sanjar_nandi	
sanjar_nandi_01	Sanjar Nandi is the current CEO of Monarch Stellar Industries, based in Stellar Bay.
sanjar_nandi_02	Sanjar began working for MSI at a young age and it was there where he met Graham Bryant, who would eventually become his best friend.
sanjar_nandi_03	Sanjar was ambitious but his attention to detail at the expense of big-picture thinking hampered his efforts within MSI.
sanjar_nandi_04	This led to negative performance reviews regarding his tendency to pad reports and talks with numbers and data,
sanjar_nandi_05	feedback which continues to haunt him many years on.
sanjar_nandi_06	However, the negative feedback did not dampen Sanjar's desire to move up within the company,
sanjar_nandi_07	even donating a kidney to one of the executives in hopes of promotion.
sanjar_nandi_08	Despite his poor performance, Sanjar always showed himself to be a loyal employee of the company.
sanjar_nandi_09	Despite Sanjar's best efforts, he has found it extremely challenging to continue operating MSI on Monarch without the backing of the Board.
sanjar_nandi_10	In order to improve the lives of the people he is responsible for, Sanjar has a plan to rejoin the Board through the use of a BOLT-52 form and proof of another corporate presence on Monarch.
sanjar_nandi_11	He is simultaneously working on a plan to reorganize the Board,
sanjar_nandi_12	hoping that his plans are not found out until MSI has been reinstated.
sanjar_nandi_13	Sanjar choosing to take over as head of MSI rather than dismantling it entirely caused a rift between him and Graham Bryant.
sanjar_nandi_14	The latter started the Iconoclasts,
sanjar_nandi_15	a group dedicated to spreading the word of Philosophism throughout the galaxy,
sanjar_nandi_16	and Sanjar was left in Stellar Bay to run the company and look after the employees who were left behind.
sanjar_nandi_17	He can also tell you more about the planet, that used to be called Terra 1
sanjar_nandi_18	and the reform that he and Monarch Stellar Industries tried to achieve to give more humane working conditions for everyone within.
the_board	
the_board_01	The Halcyon Holdings Corporate Board, also simply known as The Board,
the_board_02	institutes policy and law throughout the Halcyon Colony.
the_board_03	The details surrounding the board's founding remain largely unknown,
the_board_04	though its activities suggest that it was originally founded some seventy-odd years ago, give or take.
the_board_05	In that time, it has managed to terraform Terra I
the_board_06	(a catastrophic failure due to mutations rendering the wildlife overwhelmingly hostile to human life).
the_board_07	The Board maintains a very tense relationship with MSI, owing to MSI's democratic ideals and their declared ownership of Monarch.
the_board_08	As a result, the Board has placed Monarch, and by extension, MSI, under the Hazard Clause, which forbids off-world businesses from doing transactions on Monarch without the correct (and deliberately impossible to complete) documents.
the_board_09	Depending on the actions of the Stranger, MSI may be compelled to rebel against the Board's authoritarianism.
