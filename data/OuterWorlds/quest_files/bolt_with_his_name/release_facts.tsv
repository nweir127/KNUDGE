celia_robbins_05	She is not concerned that she and Sebastian may not have much to talk about,
celia_robbins_06	as everyone else in Stellar Bay either smells like saltuna or are her boss.
celia_robbins_07	The Stranger can offer to set her and Sebastian up on a date.
hazard_clause

huxley	
huxley_01	Huxley is a runner for the Iconoclasts.
huxley_02	Huxley is a relatively recent member of the Iconoclasts.

iconoclasts	
iconoclasts_01	The Iconoclasts are a group of survivalists living in the ruins of Amber Heights on Monarch.
iconoclasts_02	They hope to one day tear down the corporate establishment that they believe has brought the colony to the brink of death.
iconoclasts_03	The Iconoclasts are a group of idealistic revolutionaries that seek to overthrow the corporate establishment that runs the Halcyon Colony.
iconoclasts_04	Based in the ruins of the Amber Heights settlement on Monarch,
iconoclasts_05	they are a tenacious group,
iconoclasts_06	and share some democratic ideals with Monarch Stellar Industries (MSI) against the more repressive actions of the Board.
iconoclasts_07	However, the Iconoclast's anti-corporate nature has put them at odds with MSI, a dispute that threatens to spill into all-out warfare.
iconoclasts_08	Given that the Iconoclasts are mostly followers of the Philosophist faith, they have been blacklisted and demonized by the Board as dissenters and anarchists.
iconoclasts_09	The group is led by Graham Bryant, a staunch Philosophist.
iconoclasts_10	Zora Blackwood, the Iconoclasts' chief of medicine, is also considered a de facto leader of the group,
iconoclasts_11	as she was alongside Graham when he founded the Iconoclasts,
iconoclasts_12	and almost every member of the Iconoclasts owes her their life in some way.
iconoclasts_13	The Iconoclasts maintain a tense relationship with MSI.
iconoclasts_14	Despite sharing democratic values and a common desire towards egalitarianism for the people of Monarch and the wider Halcyon colony,
iconoclasts_15	"MSI's ""egalitarian corporate structure"" has proven to be at odds with some of the Iconoclasts' more radical, anti-capitalist views."
iconoclasts_16	Depending on the actions of the Stranger, this tense relationship can either be resolved,
iconoclasts_17	or can spill into a drawn-out and bloody war.
iconoclasts_18	The Stranger meets the Iconoclasts in Amber Heights just as the tension between them and MSI is reaching boiling point.
iconoclasts_19	They can either side with the Iconoclasts and assist them in storming and taking over Stellar Bay,
iconoclasts_20	"""solve"" the Iconoclast problem for Stellar Bay,"
iconoclasts_21	or broker peace between the two factions.
iconoclasts_22	The Stranger can also have an impact on the leadership of the Iconoclasts - siding with either Graham Bryant or Zora Blackwood.
iconoclasts_23	To supplant Graham with Zora, evidence of Graham's involvement in the Amber Heights massacre must be found and presented to Zora.
iconoclasts_24	The Van Noys are the Iconoclasts' best unit.
mantisaur	
mantisaur_01	Mantisaurs are insectoid creatures native to Monarch.
mantisaur_02	They are aggressive, territorial, and very strong.

mantisaur_04	The mantiqueen is the largest breed of Mantisaur.
monarch	
monarch_01	Monarch, previously known as Terra 1, is one of the many moons of the gas giant Olympus and the site of a failed colony.
monarch_02	Terra 1 was initially designated as the primary colonization target of the Halcyon system.
monarch_03	The Halcyon Holdings Corporate Board had intended to completely terraform the moon,
monarch_04	wiping out the local fauna and flora and replacing it with plants and wildlife native to Earth.
monarch_05	However, the terraforming process unexpectedly caused the native species to mutate and grow to significantly larger sizes,
monarch_06	rendering them more dangerous and severely crippling the colonization effort.
monarch_07	Due to the hostile environment which they had created,
monarch_08	the Board was forced to enact a Hazard Clause covering the entirety of Terra 1.
monarch_09	Public notice of the clause's issuance was sent to everyone operating on Terra 1 and led to the evacuation of almost all corporations from the moon.
monarch_10	However, one corporation took advantage of the chaos of the evacuation to exploit a legal loophole which allowed them to,
monarch_11	as the last corporation remaining on the planet,
monarch_12	acquire the planet from the Board.
monarch_13	This corporation, under the leadership of Sanjar Nandi and Graham Bryant subsequently rebranded itself to Monarch Stellar Industries (MSI),
monarch_14	in line with the renaming of the planet to 'Monarch'.
monarch_15	The actions of MSI earned them the ire of the Board,
monarch_16	who retaliated by effectively placing the moon under indefinite embargo,
monarch_17	refusing to allow legal transit either in or out.
monarch_18	the Board aggressively spread propaganda about Monarch to convince the rest of the population that it was both uninhabited and uninhabitable.
monarch_19	This has greatly hampered MSI's attempts to be recognized as a legitimate corporation and is a thorn in the side of its CEO, Sanjar Nandi.
monarch_20	"Monarch also has an ocean which goes around the moon at the ""twilight band""."
monarch_21	It is where the colonists and Monarch Stellar Industries farm their saltuna.
monarch_stellar_industries	
monarch_stellar_industries_01	Monarch Stellar Industries (MSI) is a corporation based on Monarch.
monarch_stellar_industries_02	Once a loyal Board-owned corporation, Monarch Stellar Industries split off to become their own private entity under the leadership of Sanjar Nandi.
monarch_stellar_industries_03	Espousing worker-centric rights and democratic ideals, Sanjar seeks to bring his own brand of freedom to the rest of Halcyon.
monarch_stellar_industries_04	MSI farms saltuna on Monarch.
monarch_stellar_industries_05	Following the failed terraforming of Monarch and the abandonment of other corporations due to the imposition of the Hazard Clause,
monarch_stellar_industries_06	the precursor to Monarch Stellar took advantage of a legal loophole to acquire possession of Monarch and re-branded their corporation to match that of their newest asset.
monarch_stellar_industries_07	Monarch Stellar's acquisition of the planet earned the ire of the Board,
monarch_stellar_industries_08	due to the loss of their asset and as such enforced an embargo on Monarch.
monarch_stellar_industries_09	MSI as a corporation espouses a more egalitarian philosophy than the other companies on The Board, valuing the rights and individual liberties of its workers and employees.
monarch_stellar_industries_10	However, the violent and wild ecosystem of Monarch, coupled with the pressure applied from the Board-authorized Hazard Clause, have forced MSI to cut corners in their attempt at survival.
monarch_stellar_industries_11	MSI maintains a tense relationship with the revolutionary band of survivalists known as the Iconoclasts,
monarch_stellar_industries_12	in part due to the Iconoclasts believing in total anti-corporate ideals,
monarch_stellar_industries_13	as opposed to MSI's more corporate-egalitarian views.
monarch_stellar_industries_14	Depending on the actions of the Stranger, the tense relationship can spill out into warfare, or be resolved peacefully.
monarch_stellar_industries_15	The Board maintains a very tense relationship with MSI, owing to MSI's democratic ideals and their declared ownership of Monarch.
monarch_stellar_industries_16	As a result, the Board has placed Monarch, and by extension, MSI, under the Hazard Clause, which forbids off-world businesses from doing transactions on Monarch without the correct (and deliberately impossible to complete) documents.
raptidon	
raptidon_01	Raptidons are giant cat/reptile-like creatures that inhabit various planets in Halcyon.
raptidon_02	They are creatures native to Monarch.
raptidon_03	however some corporations have illegally imported them to other planets,
raptidon_04	such as Auntie Cleo who relocated a group of them to Roseway.
raptidon_05	Raptidons are of corporate interest due to their potential for producing new chemical by-products which,
raptidon_06	when refined, can be used to create new board approved products.
sanjar_nandi	
sanjar_nandi_01	Sanjar Nandi is the current CEO of Monarch Stellar Industries, based in Stellar Bay.
sanjar_nandi_02	Sanjar began working for MSI at a young age and it was there where he met Graham Bryant, who would eventually become his best friend.
sanjar_nandi_03	Sanjar was ambitious but his attention to detail at the expense of big-picture thinking hampered his efforts within MSI.
sanjar_nandi_04	This led to negative performance reviews regarding his tendency to pad reports and talks with numbers and data,
sanjar_nandi_05	feedback which continues to haunt him many years on.
sanjar_nandi_06	However, the negative feedback did not dampen Sanjar's desire to move up within the company,
sanjar_nandi_07	even donating a kidney to one of the executives in hopes of promotion.
sanjar_nandi_08	Despite his poor performance, Sanjar always showed himself to be a loyal employee of the company.
sanjar_nandi_09	Despite Sanjar's best efforts, he has found it extremely challenging to continue operating MSI on Monarch without the backing of the Board.
sanjar_nandi_10	In order to improve the lives of the people he is responsible for, Sanjar has a plan to rejoin the Board through the use of a BOLT-52 form and proof of another corporate presence on Monarch.
sanjar_nandi_11	He is simultaneously working on a plan to reorganize the Board,
sanjar_nandi_12	hoping that his plans are not found out until MSI has been reinstated.
sanjar_nandi_13	Sanjar choosing to take over as head of MSI rather than dismantling it entirely caused a rift between him and Graham Bryant.
sanjar_nandi_14	The latter started the Iconoclasts,
sanjar_nandi_15	a group dedicated to spreading the word of Philosophism throughout the galaxy,
sanjar_nandi_16	and Sanjar was left in Stellar Bay to run the company and look after the employees who were left behind.
sanjar_nandi_17	He can also tell you more about the planet, that used to be called Terra 1
sanjar_nandi_18	and the reform that he and Monarch Stellar Industries tried to achieve to give more humane working conditions for everyone within.

the_board_02	institutes policy and law throughout the Halcyon Colony.
the_board_03	The details surrounding the board's founding remain largely unknown,
the_board_04	though its activities suggest that it was originally founded some seventy-odd years ago, give or take.
the_board_05	In that time, it has managed to terraform Terra I
the_board_06	(a catastrophic failure due to mutations rendering the wildlife overwhelmingly hostile to human life).
the_board_07	The Board maintains a very tense relationship with MSI, owing to MSI's democratic ideals and their declared ownership of Monarch.
the_board_08	As a result, the Board has placed Monarch, and by extension, MSI, under the Hazard Clause, which forbids off-world businesses from doing transactions on Monarch without the correct (and deliberately impossible to complete) documents.
the_board_09	Depending on the actions of the Stranger, MSI may be compelled to rebel against the Board's authoritarianism.
