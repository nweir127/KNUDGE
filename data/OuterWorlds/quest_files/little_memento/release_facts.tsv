amber_heights	
amber_heights_01	Amber Heights is a location in the Monarch Wilderness and the base of operations for the Iconoclasts.

amber_heights_03	Amber Heights was once the place of residence of the entire executive dome of Monarch Stellar Industries.
amber_heights_04	It is now in ruins after a massacre in the past.
amber_heights_05	They lived there with their families and it was the company's operations center on Monarch.
amber_heights_06	Just after The Board approved the evacuation of the planet through the Hazard Clause, Amber Heights was besieged by a gang of pirates who ransacked the town and massacred all its inhabitants.
amber_heights_07	"This tragedy was known as ""The Amber Heights Massacre""."
amber_heights_08	They were secretly assisted by MSI employee, Graham Bryant, who believed that the massacre would aid him in his quest to rid the colony of corporate influence.
amber_heights_09	In 2345, the same Graham Bryant formed the Iconoclasts and settled the group in the deserted town.
ash	
ash_01	Ash is a veteran mercenary who can be found in a bar in Amber Heights.
ash_02	During the corporate evacuation of Monarch after the Hazard Clause was enacted,
ash_03	Ash was hired to transport a hunter unit off-world.

ash_05	he received a better offer and abandoned the group at their rendezvous point,
ash_06	and they were killed while waiting for transport which would never arrive.
ash_07	He does not disclose this to the Stranger when they first meet him.
ash_08	He now spends most of his time at the bar in Amber Heights,
ash_09	telling fantastical tales about his time as a mercenary on Monarch.
ash_10	The Stranger can buy up to three drinks for Ash for 20 bits each.
ash_11	Every time he receives a drink,
ash_12	Ash will tell a fantastical story about his experiences on Monarch.

mantipillar_02	A mantipillar spits plasma balls that burn its victims.
mantipillar_03	Mantipillars are native to Monarch.
monarch	
monarch_01	Monarch, previously known as Terra 1, is one of the many moons of the gas giant Olympus and the site of a failed colony.
monarch_02	Terra 1 was initially designated as the primary colonization target of the Halcyon system.
monarch_03	The Halcyon Holdings Corporate Board had intended to completely terraform the moon,
monarch_04	wiping out the local fauna and flora and replacing it with plants and wildlife native to Earth.
monarch_05	However, the terraforming process unexpectedly caused the native species to mutate and grow to significantly larger sizes,
monarch_06	rendering them more dangerous and severely crippling the colonization effort.
monarch_07	Due to the hostile environment which they had created,
monarch_08	the Board was forced to enact a Hazard Clause covering the entirety of Terra 1.
monarch_09	Public notice of the clause's issuance was sent to everyone operating on Terra 1 and led to the evacuation of almost all corporations from the moon.
monarch_10	However, one corporation took advantage of the chaos of the evacuation to exploit a legal loophole which allowed them to,
monarch_11	as the last corporation remaining on the planet,
monarch_12	acquire the planet from the Board.
monarch_13	This corporation, under the leadership of Sanjar Nandi and Graham Bryant subsequently rebranded itself to Monarch Stellar Industries (MSI),
monarch_14	in line with the renaming of the planet to 'Monarch'.
monarch_15	The actions of MSI earned them the ire of the Board,
monarch_16	who retaliated by effectively placing the moon under indefinite embargo,
monarch_17	refusing to allow legal transit either in or out.
monarch_18	the Board aggressively spread propaganda about Monarch to convince the rest of the population that it was both uninhabited and uninhabitable.
monarch_19	This has greatly hampered MSI's attempts to be recognized as a legitimate corporation and is a thorn in the side of its CEO, Sanjar Nandi.
monarch_20	"Monarch also has an ocean which goes around the moon at the ""twilight band""."
monarch_21	It is where the colonists and Monarch Stellar Industries farm their saltuna.
