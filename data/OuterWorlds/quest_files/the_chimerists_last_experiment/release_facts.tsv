O0_B2	Lilya thinks there is an Alien invasion happening,
O0_B3	and she wants you to put a stop to it.
O0_B4	You can ask what she means by Aliens,
O0_B5	and she will say that the gas is mixing the human nuclein with Halcyon biology,
O0_B6	making us something other than human.
O0_B7	If you ask how she knows you're not an alien,
O0_B8	she will say it was a calculated risk,
O0_B9	"and she will say it's ""Probably nothing to worry about as long as you don't start growing tentacles or slowing down time""."
O0_B10	She believes that Eva Chartrand, a doctor working for UDL,
O0_B11	is running the gas experiments,
O0_B12	and wants you to kill her for the good of humanity.

O1_B16	you can pass a [Lie 1] check to threaten the well-being of her companions,
O1_B17	and a corporate commander will chastise her for sharing Board secrets.
O1_B18	You can also find out from Chartrand that the Board has lost critical,irreplaceable military resources in the form of the assault cruiser Cornelius Vanderbilt.
O1_B19	Perhaps the Board’s stranglehold over Halcyon is far more feeble than it seems?
O1_B20	At this point, there are a couple of choices.
O1_B21	The Stranger could spare her letting her continue her research for the Board (this option increases Reputation with the Board),
O1_B22	or ask her to work with Phineas Welles to help better mankind.
O1_B23	She will not need convincing for either of these,
O1_B24	but the Corporate Commander who guards will.
O1_B25	If the Stranger has more positive Reputation with the Board than negative,
O1_B26	they can bribe, Persuade (150) him into letting them go,
O1_B27	or tell him they work for Adjutant Akande if they have completed at least one of her quests.
O1_B28	Otherwise, if the Dumb or the last dialogue option is chosen,
O1_B29	the UDL guards and the automechanichals will become hostile and the Stranger can either kill them gaining negative Reputation with the Board or run away.

earth	
earth_01	Earth, located in the Sol System,
earth_02	was the homeworld of humanity,

earth_04	Prior to the 21st Century, Earth was divided into various nations,
earth_05	one of which was the United States of America.
earth_06	In the early 1900s, the tenure of US President William McKinley led to the empowerment and deregulation of powerful business trusts,
earth_07	effectively sending the nation (and subsequently, the world) into a seemingly eternal Gilded Age of unfettered capitalism.
earth_08	In the wake of the catastrophic Great War of the 21st Century,
earth_09	the Earth Directorate was formed as a planet-wide government and regulatory body,
earth_10	which would serve to catalogue and allot off-world colonies and systems beyond Directorate control to the highest bidders,
earth_11	as well as to settle and arbitrate disputes between Earth's remaining nation-states.
earth_12	During this period in time, the Skip Drive was developed,
earth_13	"which allowed spacecraft to ""skip"" beyond the speed of light,"
earth_14	effectively allowing humanity to explore the stars.
earth_15	With the presumed gradual weakening of the influence of the traditional nation-state and the continued rise of powerful corporations and firms,
earth_16	many colonization efforts were spearheaded in the name of business,
earth_17	rather than for science, religion, or political ideologies.
earth_18	Over a year prior to the events of the game,
earth_19	the Earth Directorate cruiser J.J. Astor was the only Earth Directorate ship remaining in the Halcyon system,
earth_20	dedicated to preserving the prosperity and peace of Halcyon's government.
earth_21	During the course of the game,
earth_22	it is eventually revealed that the last Earth Directorate ship headed for Earth from Halcyon, the Cornelius Vanderbilt,
earth_23	"vanished, apparently discovering something that led to Earth ""going dark"","
earth_24	effectively cutting off all communications and supplies from Earth to Halcyon and numerous other off-world colonies.

earth_26	the Halcyon Colony was left to fend on its own as an independent colony or remain under Board control.
